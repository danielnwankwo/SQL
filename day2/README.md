#Normal Forms

- 1st Normal Form
   - Each column of your table should be single valued which means they should not contain multiple values

   - Make everything Atomic (data must be presented as small as it can be)


#2nd Normal Form

- The table should be in the First Normal Form
- There should be no Partial Dependency

# 3rd Normal Form

-  When a table is in the Second Normal Form and has no transitive dependency, then it is in the Third Normal Form
  
## Transient dependency:

  - when a non-key column is Functionally Dependent on another non-key column, which is Functionally Dependent on the Primary Key
